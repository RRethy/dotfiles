## Getting started

Welcome! Whether you are new to Go or an experienced Go developer, we hope this extension will fit your needs and enhance your development experience.

### Install Go

Before you start coding, make sure that you have already installed Go, as explained in the [Go installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install).

If you are unsure whether you have installed Go, open the Command Palette in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run the [`Go: Locate Configured Go Tools`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/commands.md#go-locate-configured-go-tools) command. If the `GOROOT` output is empty, you are missing a Go installation. For help installing Go, ask a question on the `#newbies` [Gophers Slack] channel.

### Set up your environment

Read about [Go code organization](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) to learn how to configure your environment. This extension works in both [GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/gopath.md) and [module](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/modules.md) modes. We suggest using modules, as they are quickly becoming the new standard in the Go community.

Here are some additional resources for learning about how to set up your Go project:

* [Using Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules)
* [Modules wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules)
* [GOPATH](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable)

**NOTE: If you are using modules, we recommend using the Go [language server](#language-server), which is explained below.**

More advanced users may be interested in using different `GOPATH`s or Go versions per-project. You can learn about the different `GOPATH` manipulation options in the [`GOPATH` documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/gopath.md). Take a look at the other [customization](#customization) options as well.

### Install the extension

If you haven't already done so, install and open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Navigate to the Extensions pane (Ctrl+Shift+X). Search for "Go" and install this extension (the publisher ID is `golang.Go`).

### Activate the Go extension

To activate the extension, open any directory or workspace containing Go code.

You should immediately see a prompt in the bottom-right corner of your screen titled `Analysis Tools Missing`. This extension relies on a suite of [command-line tools](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/tools.md), which must be installed separately. Accept the prompt, or use the [`Go: Install/Update Tools`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/commands.md#go-installupdate-tools) command to pick which tools you would like to install.

If you see an error that looks like `command Go: Install/Update Tools not found`, it means that the extension has failed to activate and register its commands. Please uninstall and then reinstall the extension.

### Start coding

You're ready to Go!

Be sure to learn more about the many [features](#features) of this extension, as well as how to [customize](#customization) them. Take a look at [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md) and [Help](#ask-for-help) for further guidance.

## Support for Go modules

[Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) have added a lot of complexity to the way that most tools and features are built for Go. Some, but not all, [features](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/features.md) of this extension have been updated to work with Go modules. Some features may also be slower in module mode. The [features documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/features.md) contains more specific details.

**In general, we recommend using [`gopls`, the official Go language server](https://golang.org/s/gopls), if you are using modules.** Read more [below](#language-server) and in the [`gopls` documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/gopls.md).

## [Features](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/features.md)

This extension has a wide range of features, including [Intellisense](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/features.md#intellisense), [code navigation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/features.md#code-navigation), and [code editing](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/features.md#code-editing) support. It also shows build, vet, and lint [diagnostics](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/features.md#diagnostics) as you work and provides enhanced support for [testing](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/features.md##run-and-test-in-the-editor) and [debugging](#debugging) your programs. For more detail, see the [full feature breakdown](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/features.md).

In addition to integrated editing features, the extension also provides several commands for working with Go files. You can access any of these by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and typing in the name of the command. See the [full list of commands](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/commands.md#detailed-list) provided by the extension.

The majority of the extension's functionality comes from command-line tools. If you're experiencing an issue with a specific feature, you may want to investigate the underlying tool. You can do this by taking a look at the [full list of tools used by this extension](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/tools.md).

### [Debugging](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md)

Debugging is a major feature offered by this extension. For a comprehensive overview of how to debug your Go programs, please see the [debugging guide](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md).

## Customization

This extension needs no configuration; it works out of the box. However, you may wish to modify settings to adjust your experience.

Many of the features are configurable to your preference. A few common modifications are mentioned below, but take a look at the [full list of settings](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md) for an overview.

### [Linter](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/tools.md#diagnostics)

A commonly customized feature is the linter, which is a tool used to provide coding style feedback and suggestions. By default, this extension uses the official [`golint`].

However, you are welcome to use more advanced options like [`staticcheck`](https://pkg.go.dev/honnef.co/go/tools/staticcheck?tab=overview), [`golangci-lint`](https://golangci-lint.run/), or [`revive`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mgechev/revive?tab=overview). This can be configured via the [`"go.lintTool"`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md#go.lintTool) setting, and the different options are explained more thoroughly in the [list of diagnostic tools](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/tools.md#diagnostics).

### [GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/gopath.md)

Advanced users may want to set different `GOPATH`s for different projects or install the Go tools to a different `GOPATH`. This is possible and explained in the [`GOPATH documentation`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/gopath.md).

## [Language Server](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/gopls.md)

In the default mode, the Go extension relies upon a suite of [command-line tools](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/tools.md). A new alternative is to use a [single language server](https://langserver.org/), which provides language features through the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).

The Go team at Google has developed [`gopls`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/gopls.md), which is the official Go language server. It is currently in an alpha state and under active development.

[`gopls`] is recommended for projects that use Go modules.

To opt-in to the language server, set [`"go.useLanguageServer"`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md#go.useLanguageServer) to `true` in your settings. You should then be prompted to install [`gopls`]. If you are not prompted, you can install `gopls` manually by running the [`Go: Install/Update Tools`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/commands.md#go-installupdate-tools) command and selecting `gopls`.

For more information, see the [`gopls` documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/gopls.md).
